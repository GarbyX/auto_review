<h2><u> Today's Auto Review: Toyota Highlander (all year models)</u></h2>

<p> Announced in April 2000 at the New York Auto Show and arriving in late 2000 in Japan and January, 2001, in North America, the Highlander became the first car-based midsize SUV or midsize crossover. The Highlander is the crossover counterpart to the more rugged, truck-based midsize 4Runner and became Toyota's best-selling SUV before being surpassed by the smaller RAV4 in 2006.</p>

<p>
Here in Nigeria, it is a very popular SUV to see on a daily basis. Many owners can attest to its reliability, strength and performance.</p>

<h2 id="2001–2007 Models"><u> 2001–2007
Models </u></h2>

<img src ="Images/Toyota_Highlander_Limited 2001-2003.jpg" border ="2"  height=100 width=150 alt ="2001-2003 Toyota Highlander Limited" title ="2001-2003 Toyota Highlander Limited">


It came in five (2001–2007) and seven-seat (2004–2007) configurations and became a sales success for Toyota in a number of markets across the world. The Highlander came standard with front wheel drive and offered all wheel drive (50:50 front:rear fixed torque split). Unlike Toyota's own 4Runner and other midsized competitors such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, or Chevrolet TrailBlazer, the Highlander aimed for on-road comfort with its unit body construction and independent rear suspension. Although it was longer than the 1996–2002 4Runner available at the time it was launched, the Highlander was surpassed in length by the redesigned 4Runner in 2002.
</p>

<p>

The Highlander was available in three trim lines: <p>

<ol type="I">
<li>The Base model
</li>
<li> The Sport model
</li>
<li> The Limited model </li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">
The Base and Limited models were present when the Highlander was initially introduced, while the Sport model was introduced in March 2006
. In 2004 the wheels on the Limited trim changed from a six-spoke, to a five-spoke alloy. The base-model Highlander wheels also changed from steel-rims to the alloy wheels that were on the 2001–2003 model year Highlander Limited and B-Package. The Sport models had a distinctive grille design, differentiating themselves from the non-Sport models. Wheel styling also serves to differentiate the various models—the hybrid sports a unique twin-spoke design.

In addition to the 3.3-liter engine, 2004 V6-powered models were equipped with a new five-speed automatic transmission, replacing a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 4-cylinder models continued to use the old 4-speed automatic transmission. This year also saw the introduction of the optional third row seat allowing for two additional passengers. The unibody was slightly modified behind the second row seats to include a depression in the trunk floor able to accommodate the optional third row seating. On models without third row seating, this depression was turned into a storage compartment. (Prior to 2004 the spare tire was accessible from inside the vehicle where the third row seating would subsequently be located; beginning in 2004 the spare tire is accessible from underneath the vehicle.) Subtle changes to the front grille, front and rear bumpers, and headlights round-out the major changes for the 2004 mid-cycle refresh. </p>

<h2 id="2007–2013 Models" ><u> Toyota Highlander 2007–2013 Models </u></h2>

Initially the sole powertrain for the 2008 Highlander was a 270 horsepower (201 kW) 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 mated to a five-speed automatic. The four-cylinder model had been discontinued but added again in 2009. While the 3.5-liter engine has 55 more bhp than the previous 3.3-liter V6 and dimensional increases along with increased sound proofing added nearly 500 pounds to the vehicle's curb weight of approximately 4,000 lbs, fuel economy is slightly improved. For 2009, Toyota again offered a 4-cylinder for 5-passenger front-wheel drive models with the all-new ULEV-II certified 2.7-liter 1AR-FE I4 paired to a six-speed automatic. It generates 187 hp (139 kW) at 5,800 rpm and 186 lb·ft (252 N·m) of peak torque at 4,100 rpm on regular 87 octane fuel.

For the 2011 model year, Toyota made some changes to the Highlander and Highlander Hybrid. While the general design remains similar to the 2010 model, the Highlander's front end has been significantly revised, now featuring new headlights, a new black with chrome accent rocker panel, and new front grille. The non-hybrid engines for 2011 remain the same, although now the 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine may be had on the SE trim level, previously only available on the base model. More standard features are now equipped on all trim levels, with the base model receiving front and rear air conditioning, power locks/windows, cruise control, and a multi-function keyless entry control.

 This version is longer and wider than the outgoing generation and its design has changed from its boxy look to one that is similar to other mid-size SUVs, yet remain in the crossover realm. In addition to the changes, this one features seating for eight people with a sliding second-row point of entry that gives it 4.3 inches of added width space, soft-touch materials on the instrument panel, lane-departure warning, pre-collision warning and blind spot monitoring systems. HD Radio and Bluetooth will become a standard on all trims for the US version, which will also come equipped with Toyota's Entune multimedia system along with a 6.1-inch touchscreen display audio system. An eight-inch touchscreen system and Toyota's Entune app suite with 12 JBL speakers will be offered as an optional feature. The three powertrain trims that will be offered include a 2.7L/6-speed front-wheel drive base model, a 3.5L/6-speed 6AT model in both front wheel or all wheel drive, and the AWD-only Hybrid trim with a 3.5L/V6 mated to an eCVT. <br><br>
